Hi! I'm the Nv7 bot! I am a bot made by Nv7!

**Givenum**
In givenum, you give yourself a number. Then, and admin will run a command that will choose a random number out of all of the submitted numbers. The admin decides what to do with the results!
	`givenum <number>` - Give yourself a number! This will be useful later
	`getnum` - Find what your number is, in case you forget. Mention people in this message to get their numbers!
	`randselect` - Run this command to select a random number out of all the numbers people have and congratulate them!

**Currency**
The Nv7 Bot offers a whole new take on currency! You have 3 values:
	`wallet` - This is your wallet! To spend money, your money needs to be in your wallet. People can rob your wallet though.
	`bank` - This is safe from robbers, but you can't spend money that is in the bank. 
	`credit` - To buy properties (get to that later), you need to have a different amount of credit. Your credit score can never go down.

Use the following commands to change these values - for `with` and `dep` you can use `all` to do the maximum value possible.
	`with <input>` - Withdraw money from the bank and put it in your wallet.
	`dep <input>` - Deposit money from your wallet into the bank.
	`credup <number>` - Upgrade your credit score!

You can use `daily` to make 2500 coins every day.

Use these commands to get information. If you don't mention anyone, it will get your information. Otherwise, you will get information on the first person you mention.
	`bal` - Get your wallet, bank, and credit score.
	`inv` - See what properties someone owns!
	`ldb` - Get a leaderboard of the richest people in your server.
	`props` - Get a list of all available properties!

Properties are companies you own. Properties you own make a certain amount of money every hour. Some properties cost more, but make more every hour. You can upgrade a property to make it make more money too.
	`purchase` - Buy a property!
	`upgrade` - Upgrade a property!
	`collect` - Collect money from your businesses!

**Other Commands**
	`meme` - Get a meme fresh off of reddit!
