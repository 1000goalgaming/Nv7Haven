Hi! I'm the Nv7 bot! I am a bot made by Nv7!
Currency was a little wordy so run `7help currency` to get help on currency. Sorry!

**Givenum**
In givenum, you give yourself a number. Then, and admin will run a command that will choose a random number out of all of the submitted numbers. The admin decides what to do with the results!

	`getnum` - Find what your number is, in case you forget. Mention people in this message to get their numbers!
	`randselect` - Run this command to select a random number out of all the numbers people have and congratulate them!

	`warns <@user>` - Get warnings for a user
	`warns` - Get all warnings in this server.
