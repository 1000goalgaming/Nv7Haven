EoD Everywhere is an Elemental game built entirely with a Discord bot. Check out the **Using the Bot** section to learn about the commands! Each server has a separate element list and can be customized by server admins to change channel types, vote counts, and even directly modify a user's inventory! Check out the **Useful Admin Commands** section for more info.

You can see the information on an element with **?<element name>** or using **/get**
