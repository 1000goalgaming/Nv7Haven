EoD Everywhere is an Elemental game built entirely with a Discord bot. Check out the **Using the Bot** section to learn about the commands! Each server has a separate element list and can be customized by server admins to change channel types, vote counts, and even directly modify a user's inventory! Check out the **Useful Admin Commands** section for more info.

**Using the Bot**
You can combine elements in any play channel using **elem1 + elem2** or **elem1, elem2**
You can see the information on an element with **?<element name>**
You can add an image to an element with **/image**
You can add a creator mark to an element with **/mark**
You can view categories with **/cat** and add elements to categories with **/addcat**
You can use **/lb** to view the leaderboard and **/inv** to see what elements you have
