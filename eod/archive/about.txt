EoD Everywhere is an Elemental game built entirely with a Discord bot. Check out the **Using the Bot** section to learn about the commands! Each server has a separate element list and can be customized by server admins to change channel types, vote counts, and even directly modify a user's inventory! Check out the **Useful Admin Commands** section for more info.

**Using the Bot**
You can combine elements in any play channel by seperating element names by a **+**, **,**, or a **line break**.
You can combine up to 20 elements, and element names can be up to 240 characters long!
For example, you can do **air, air, air**.
You can see the information on an element with **?<element name>**, and **?#<element id>** to get info by ID
Add a creator mark to an element with **/mark**
View categories with **/cat**
Add elements to categories with **/addcat** and remove elements from categories with **/rmcat**
Add an image to an element with **/image**, and to a category with **/catimg**
Use **/lb** to view the leaderboard and **/inv** to see what elements you have
Use **/hint** to get a hint on how to make an element
Use **/idea** to get a random unused combination
Use **/path** to get the path for an element, or **/catpath** to get the path for all elements in a category
Use **/stats** to get the server's stats
